I searched vscode on google. Then I downloaded the app.

* [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) 
* [Connect to a remote host](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host)

I opened terminal in vscode. Then I remote connect by the command ```ssh cs15lsp22akp@ieng6.ucsd.edu```

* ##Trying Some Commands

I tried a couple different basic commands after I connected successfully. I used ```ls -a``` command to enlist the whole list of the current directory including the hidden files.

* ##Moving file with scp

First of all, I used cd to add the WhereAmI to the directory. And then I can use scp command to move my file to the server.

* ##Setting an SSH key 
* [ssh-add](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation)

I used a command called ```ssh keygen```. It could help me create a public key and private key. Since I finished, I could use the key to log in the sever.

Since I finished setting my SSh key, I can log in to the server without my original password. And I can do a lot of commands more effiency.
